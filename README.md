# Custom API Token authentication for Laravel

This is the demo repo for the associated dev.to article and tutorial.

Please find it here on dev.to, [Custom Token Authentication for Laravel](https://dev.to)

## About

This demo application has the token authentication methods described in the tutorial so that you are able to get a running test up and going if you just want to see it in action.

The authentication method behind this app is that you get the API token and it is only visible once off as the hash of that token is stored in the database. This makes it that only one person would have that token.

The method for authenticating the users tokens actually extends the default Laravel token auth.
